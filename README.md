I wanted to take a break and work on something else with a little bit of multiplayer compatability that I could dust off in a week or so.

I am still working on my simple_survival game, but I wanted a little change of pace.

TODO Note for self: Brother. Finish the spell casting.

First fininsh the fireball spell and auto load all of the spells in the spells folder then.
Once you do that test it. Then we can move on to actually dusting off level generation and adding enemys.

New Goal: Kill everything, explore to collect new goodies like potions and maybe finda blood altar.
Blood altar unlock either more health more mana or a new spell. You get four spells.
Blood is xp.
