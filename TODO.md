Literally a big todo list so I can keep track of what I need to get done so I don't get lost.

Bottom is the more important or do sooner, while higher is later.

TODO: Add more spells
TODO: Add particles and particle systems.
TODO: Fix Animations.
TODO: Add Animations to enemeys / ai.
TODO: Fix UI.
    NOTE: I kind of want to bring the old ui back, or maybe do a redesign / mock up.
TODO: Add mana upgrades or wand system.
TODO: Implement getting to the next floor.
TODO: Implement room generation or make rooms more extesible so each room can have a purpose.
TODO: FIX LIGHTING SYSTEM.
TODO: Add blood experience and upgrade system.
TODO: Add health visualization
    Note: Red flashes indicated how dead.
TODO: Fix Ui.
TODO: Reorganize and make a entities folder. DONE!
TODO: Implement extensible AI DONE!
    NOTE: I am thinking of creating a component that has a pointer to an extensible class that handles ai.
    NOTE: I might want to use LUA. But that is a lot to implement so probably not.
